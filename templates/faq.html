                <div class="faq-answer-content">
                    <p><strong>Criminal cases</strong> involve violations of laws that are considered offenses against the state/society. These are prosecuted by the state and can result in penalties like fines or imprisonment.</p>
                    <p><strong>Civil cases</strong> involve disputes between individuals or organizations, typically concerning rights, obligations, or compensation. Outcomes usually involve monetary damages or specific performance.</p>
                    <p>Key differences:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Burden of proof: "Beyond reasonable doubt" (criminal) vs "Balance of probabilities" (civil)</li>
                        <li>Parties: State vs Defendant (criminal) vs Plaintiff vs Defendant (civil)</li>

                        <li>Factors considered: nature of offense, strength of evidence, ties to community, likelihood of absconding</li>
                        <li>Bail may involve cash deposit or surety (someone vouching for you)</li>
                        <li>Some serious offenses have bail restrictions</li>
                        <li>Bail conditions (like reporting to police) may be imposed</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="faq-answer-content">
                    <p>In Zimbabwe, the sole ground for divorce is "irretrievable breakdown of the marriage." This means the marriage has broken down to such an extent that it cannot be saved. The court considers factors like:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adultery with breakdown of trust</li>
                        <li>Desertion for at least 2 years</li>
                        <li>Unreasonable behavior making cohabitation intolerable</li>
                        <li>Separation for at least 4 years (if both agree) or 5 years (if one party objects)</li>
                        <li>Mental illness or continuous unconsciousness for at least 5 years</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Child custody in Zimbabwe is determined based on the "best interests of the child" principle. Courts consider:</p>

                        <li>The child's age, sex and personal circumstances</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Joint custody is possible if parents can cooperate. Maintenance is typically ordered for the non-custodial parent to contribute financially.</p>

                    <p>Inheritance rights in Zimbabwe have evolved significantly:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>For civil marriages:</strong> Surviving spouses inherit the matrimonial home and 50% of remaining estate if there are children</li>
                        <li><strong>For customary marriages:</strong> Recent reforms prevent disinheritance of widows and children</li>

                        <li>Wills can specify distribution, but courts may intervene if they unfairly disadvantage dependents</li>
                        <li>The Deceased Estates Succession Act protects vulnerable family members</li>
